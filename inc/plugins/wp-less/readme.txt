Implementation of LESS (Leaner CSS) in order to make themes development easier.


== Description ==
[LESS](http://lesscss.org) is a templating language based on top of CSS. It provides numerous enhancements to speed up development and make its maintenance easier.

Theme developers can even bundle the plugin without worrying about conflicts: just include the special `bootstrap-for-theme.php` and read its instructions.

= Features =

 * Variables
 * Mixins (inheritance of rules)
 * Nested Rules (write less, do more)
 * Accessors (inherit a value from a specific rule)
 * Functions (logic operations for dynamic results)

The plugin lets you concentrate on what you need: coding CSS. Everything else is handled automatically, from cache management to user delivery.
Seriously.

= Documentation =

Advanced topics on how to use the plugin API are [available on the Github project documentation](https://github.com/oncletom/wp-less/tree/master/doc).

= Requirements =

The sole requirement is to use WordPress API and LESS convention: the `.less` extension.

**Minimal Requirements**: PHP 5.3 and WordPress 3.2.
**Relies on**: [Less.php](http://lessphp.gpeasy.com/), [plugin-toolkit](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/plugin-toolkit/).

*Notice*: in case you'd like to drop the usage of this plugin, it's safe to do it. You will just need to convert back your stylesheets to CSS.

== Installation ==

= Automatic =
 1. Search for the plugin name (`WP-LESS`)
 1. Click on the install button
 1. Activate it

= Manual =
 1. Download the latest stable archive of the plugin
 1. Unzip it in your plugin folder (by default, `wp-content/plugins`)
 1. Activate it through your WordPress plugins administration page
